## Health Data Challenge (2nd edition): Matrix factorization and deconvolution methods to quantify tumor heterogeneity in cancer research

*from November 25, 2019 to November 29, 2019*

This interdisciplinary challenge will be dedicated to the quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity using appropriate statistical methods on transcriptomic and methylation data.

### Invited speakers

- **Michael Scherer** from Max-Planck-Institut fur Informatik, Saarbrucken, Germany
- **Francisco Avila Cobos** from Ghent University, Gand, Belgium
- **Jerome Cros** from AP-HP, Paris, France

### Organizers

- Yuna Blum & Florent Petitprez (Programme CIT, LNCC, Paris, France)
- Magali Richard & Alexis Arnaud (CNRS, UGA, Grenoble, France)

### Scientific challenge

Successful treatment of cancer is still a challenge and this is partly due to a wide heterogeneity of cancer composition across patient population.
Unfortunately, accounting for such heterogeneity is very difficult. Clinical evaluation of tumor heterogeneity often requires the expertise of anatomical pathologists and radiologists.
This challenge will be dedicated to the quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity using appropriate statistical methods on (DNA) methylome and transcriptomic data in cancer.
In particular, it will focus on estimating cell types and proportion in biological samples (in vivo and in silico mixtures) for which transcriptome and/or methylome profiles have been generated.
The goal is to explore various statistical methods for source separation/deconvolution analysis (Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Surrogate Variable Analysis, Principal component Analysis, Latent Factor Models, …).
Participants will be made aware of several pitfalls when analyzing omics data (large datasets, missing data, different type of technologies/omics…).
This challenge will also be a unique opportunity to compare the performance of deconvolution methods between transcriptome and methylome data, which might have a great impact on clinical practice.
Participants will work in interdisciplinary teams.


### Who can attend?

Undergrads, PhD students, postdoc, researchers, professors, clinicians and employees from the private sector are welcome.
We look for interdisciplinary expertise in biology, computer science, statistics, bioinformatics or medical sciences.
We expect that participants are familiar with R programming language (or equivalent) and with basic statistical notions. No prior knowledge in omics data is required.

Participants should bring their personal laptops.


### General context

Health data challenge is part of a program dedicated to innovation in education. The aim of this program is to provide (i) analytical frameworks to bridge the gap between large dataset and personalized medicine in disease treatments and (ii) innovative pedagogical methods to train students and health professionals to big data analysis in health science. Integrating a large amount of data from different sources and using this knowledge to better characterize specificities of each individual will provide significant opportunities to improve disease diagnosis and to adapt accordingly patients’ treatment and care.

### Where and when
The challenge will take place during 5 days (November 25-29th, 2019) in Aussois, Vanoise, a charming small village in the Vanoise National Park (French Alps). It will end at 12pm on November 29th. If you want to leave Aussois after November 29th, you should spend the last night in another hotel nearby (e.g. hotel des mottets). The remote setting, along with the challenging program, were chosen to promote and enhance interactions between participants.

How to come

- Flight

The closest airport is at Lyon Saint Exupery but you might also arrive in Paris. Then you should take the train from the airport to Modane. Check on the website of the SNCF for timetables and reservation.

- Train

The most convenient way to come to Aussois is to arrive by train at the railway station in Modane. Then, a bus shuttle will pick you up to go to the conference center (~15 minutes by bus). Please contact us if you need us to book the shuttle or if you want further information.
You can check timetables on the SNCF website.

- Car

There is a freeway to Modane, which is located at 15-20 minutes of the conference center in Aussois.
The tourist office provides additional information...

### Registration

Registration fees include attendance to the courses, food, bus from the station, housing, conference banquet, and the social event on Wednesday. The challenge is limited to 48 participants.
